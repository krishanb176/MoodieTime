There was a problem  with android studio. My system kept crashing, so I could not even start with the apk building process. 
Plus I have never uesed Android Studio so it would have taken a while to get started with it and implement the codes. I got problems with implementing
IP address location, though I can explain you what I would do next to get it right.
The Java codes work, just could not build an apk out of it. 
The GUI part is still a challenge for me, but with practice and your guidelines, I think I will be able to learn it pretty quickly 
I look forward to hearing from you.
